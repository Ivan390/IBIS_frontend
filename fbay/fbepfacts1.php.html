 ever encroaching urbanization of the city has resulted in the False Bay
 Ecology Park being 'boxed' in on the East, North and West, as may be 
seen from the details below.<br><br>This has resulted in a very dense 
avian population being present in the Park as the the loss of water 
habitat on the Cape Flats and elsewhere forced the migration of water 
birds, in particular, to this region.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resultant concentration is of significant regional, national and international importance.<br><br>In
 addition, this 'cramped, impacted' avian habitat has the distinction of
 containing the worlds highest concentration of threatened Red Data book
 species that are on the brink of extinction.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
 National Botanical Institute has identified 36 core conservation sites,
 3 of which are situated in the Park, that are necessary to ensure a 
continued bio-diversity level of 95%, for the Table Mountain Nature 
Reserve, one of the world's 6 plant kingdoms.<br><br>Further threats are
 the proposed construction of a tolled 6 lane dual highway, the R300, 
along the approximate alignment in green below.<br><br>This proposed 
construction will sever the FBEP into two pieces resulting in 
unsustainable genetic 'islands' for all the flora and fauna and further 
reduction of already scarce water bird habitat.<br><br>Associated environmental pollution in the form of light, noise, exhaust fumes and potential spillage will also impact.<br><br>Additionally,
 high mortality rates are to be expected of mammals, insects and birds 
that cross the roadway as these migrate between feeding and nesting 
areas. </font></p><table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="791"><tbody><tr><td width="129"><p align="center"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proposed R300 Toll Road.</font></strong></p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <span class="style2">BLUE</span> alignment approximates the route for the North R300 link.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <span class="style8">GREEN</span> alignment approximates the route for the South R300 link through the FBEP. </font></p></td><td width="648"><div align="right"><img src="fbepfacts1.php_files/alignment_map472.jpg" height="479" width="640"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Regional Ornithological Importance:</strong><br>The

 canal, some land area and the False Bay Ecology Park to the South.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This
 reserve's water catchment area includes water from the Cape Flats local
 aquifer and polluted urban storm water runoff from Princess Vlei,

giving rise to high levels of nutrient and sedimentation from these 
artificial inflows.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It

vlei is regarded as the final manifestation of one of the Cape Flats 
Aquifers with additional water flowing in from two man made drainage 
canals known as the Big and Small Lotus Rivers which drain large 
residential, horticultural and industrial areas situated to the North

tending to partially split the water area.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This results in two distinctly different water environments namely Home Bay and Stormy Bay where a variety of water <a href="http://www.fbep.co.za/fbepactivities1.htm">activities</a> are enjoyed.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
 prevailing summer South Easterly winds that blow over False Bay are

 it supports an appreciable assemblage of rare, vulnerable or endangered
 species or subspecies of plant or animal, or an appreciable number of 
individuals of any one or more of these species; - or </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b)
 it is of special value for maintaining the genetic and ecological 
diversity of a region because of the quality and peculiarities of its 
flora and fauna; - or </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c) it is of special value as the habitat of plants or animals at a critical stage of their biological cycle; - or </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d) it is of special value for one or more endemic plant or animal species or communities.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>3.

 where data on populations are available, it regularly supports 1% of 
the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of 
waterfowl.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Guidelines for Application of Criteria.</strong><br>(a)
 A wetland could be considered of international importance under 
Criterion 1 if, because of its outstanding role in natural, biological, 
ecological or hydrological systems, it is of substantial value in 
supporting human communities dependent on the wetland. In this context, 
such support would include:<br><br>provision of food, fibre or fuel; - or maintenance of cultural values;<br>or support of food chains, water quality, flood control or climatic stability. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The
 support, in all aspects, should remain within the framework of 
sustainable use and habitat conservation, and should not change the 
ecological character of the wetland. - or</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b)
 A wetland could be considered of international importance under 
Criterion 1, 2 or 3 if it conforms to additional guidelines developed at
 regional (e.g. Scandinavian or West African) or national level. 
Elaboration of such regional or national guidelines may be especially 
appropriate:</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where particular groups of animals (other than waterfowl) or plants are considered more suitable as a basis for evaluation;<br></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">or where waterfowl and other animals do not occur in large concentrations (particularly in northern latitudes);<br></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">or where collection of data is difficult (particularly in very large countries). - or</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(c)
 The "particular groups of waterfowl, indicative of wetland values, 
productivity or diversity" in Criterion 3(b) include any of the 
following:<br><br>loons or divers: Gaviidae; - grebes: Podicipedidae;<br>cormorants: Phalacrocoracidae; - pelicans: Pelecanidae;<br>herons, bitterns, storks, ibises and spoonbills: Ciconiiformes; - cranes: Gruidae;<br>swans, geese and ducks (wildfowl): Anatidae; - shorebirds or waders: Charadrii; and<br>wetland related raptors: Accipitriformes and Falconiformes; - terns: Sternidae. - or </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(d)
 The specific criteria based on waterfowl numbers will apply to wetlands
 of varying size in different Contracting Parties. While it is 
impossible to give precise guidance on the size of an area in which 
these numbers may occur, wetlands identified as being of international 
importance under Criterion 3 should form an ecological unit, and may 
thus be made up of one big area or a group of smaller wetlands. 
Consideration may also be given to turnover of waterfowl at migration 
periods, so that a cumulative total is reached, if such data are 
available. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Classification System for "Wetland Type"</strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Marine and Coastal Wetlands:</strong><br>1.Marine waters - permanent shallow waters less than six metres deep at low tide; includes sea bays, straits.<br>2.Sub tidal aquatic beds; includes kelp beds, sea-grasses, tropical marine meadows.<br>3.Coral reefs.<br>4.Rocky marine shores; includes rocky offshore islands, sea cliffs.<br>5.Sand, shingle or pebble beaches; includes sand bars, spits, sandy islets.<br>6.Estuarine waters; permanent waters of estuaries and estuarine systems of deltas.<br>7.Intertidal mud, sand or salt flats.<br>8.Intertidal marshes; includes salt marshes, salt meadows, saltings, raised salt marshes, tidal brackish and freshwater marshes.<br>9.Intertidal forested wetlands; includes mangrove swamps, nipa swamps, tidal freshwater swamp forests.<br>10.Brackish to saline lagoons with one or more relatively narrow connections with the sea.<br>11.Freshwater lagoons and marshes in the coastal zone; includes delta lagoon and marsh systems. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Inland Wetlands:</strong><br>1.Permanent rivers and streams; includes waterfalls.<br>2.Seasonal and irregular rivers and streams.<br>3.Inland deltas (permanent).<br>4.Riverine flood plains; includes river flats, flooded river basins, seasonally flooded grassland, savannah, and palm savannah.<br>5.Permanent freshwater lakes (over 8 ha); includes large oxbow lakes.<br>6.Seasonal freshwater lakes (over 8 ha), floodplain lakes.<br>7.Permanent and seasonal, brackish, saline or alkaline lakes, flats and marshes.<br>8.Permanent
