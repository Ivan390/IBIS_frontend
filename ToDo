cleaned up some of the style cruff but there are couple more pages to go.
i will have each page have its own sheet at least for now to simplify this shit.

the subscript values on the chemical formulas for minerals...alas no one will ever know ;-)

So I have the base functions working, now what?
 I need a method of restoring edited data from the edits table.
 There should be an option on the edits page that shows how many times
 the page has been edited and visited.
 There should be a gallery with pictures that have not been identified
  with a facility that allows users to ID specimens
 There should also be a users gallery where registered users can keep
   track of their edits

The contribRef value is not being captured for inputs in the database, 
I must check that shit.

the edit stuff page needs a link to the relevant glossary and lookup list.
and the dates are still not being set properly.

when a registered user accesses the editstuff page,
there will be a div showing how many times the page has been edited
also a button that allows the user to view and posssibly retrieve a past version of a dataset
now how to implement this?
<div id="versionEd">
	<div id="verText">
	/*this is filled when the page loads
	and will display something like "This page has been edited #number of times. click the button to view edits"
	at this point the user clicks the <input type="button" onclick="getEdits()" value="blahhh">
	*/
	</div> 
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function getEdits(){
		/*
			which runs an AJAX query on the database sending in the ID of the species as a parameter
			the php backend returns a list of datasets eg(dataset1val1:dataset1val2:dataset1val3::dataset2val1:dataset2val2....
			which this function then splits into an array of datasets
			it iterates through the list and foreach dataset {
				split the dataset into individual values
				write a div that displays the set
				it will need a counter based on the  so that the divs can have unique ids
			}
		*/
		
		}
	</script>
