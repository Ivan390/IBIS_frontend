cleaned up some of the style cruff but there are couple more pages to go.
i will have each page have its own sheet at least for now to simplify this shit.

the subscript values on the chemical formulas for minerals...alas no one will ever know ;-)

So I have the base functions working, now what?
 I need a method of restoring edited data from the edits table.
 There should be an option on the edits page that shows how many times
 the page has been edited and visited.
 There should be a gallery with pictures that have not been identified
  with a facility that allows users to ID specimens
 There should also be a users gallery where registered users can keep
   track of their edits

The contribRef value is not being captured for inputs in the database, 
I must check that shit.

the edit stuff page needs a link to the relevant glossary and lookup list.
and the dates are still not being set properly.
