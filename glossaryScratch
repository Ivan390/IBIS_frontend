so I want a form that lets me collect glossary terms into the IBIS database
I'm thinking a php script that connects to the other functions page
so only available to registered editors
I will call it "Edit Vegetable Glossary"

basicalyy....
	present the form
	enter a term its definition and maybe add a diagram image with a caption
	click/or enter submits the data to IBIS via AJAX call
returns green check mark on no error
increments term entry count to present subtext "you have entered 'entryCount' terms"
clear elements for additional entry
returns red check mark and error message on submission failure
but then nothing is ever that easy.

soooo
the term and definition entry is fine
uploading pictures and captions seem to be trick
first select the pictures and collect them in a div adding a onclick trigger to each one
in fact its quite similar to what i did on the editdata form....

jquery basic ajax transaction
$.post("../../vegGlEntry.php3", $('#glossEntry').serialize(), function(data){
	alert(data);
}); 
return false
