This is the backend files for IBIS an Indexed Biological Information Service
I wanted to learn web developement and I needed a problem to solve, also I have a keen interest in nature but I never know the names of stuff. So I came up with this. Its basically a browser interface to a sql database that serves information on biological stuff. Notice the lack of complicated scientific words,...well that is because I have no scientific background. I am in fact an idiot, but I am an idiot who likes interesting problems. My problem is having an easy way to look up information on biological "stuff". 
These php scripts are mostly functional although the image processing function make use of the  ImageMagick 6.7.7-10 graphics library which is about the only external library. I am still tryingto use th
e gd library which is bundled with php but I'm still working it.
